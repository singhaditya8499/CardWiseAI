The additional 3 points will appear on your billing statement in a separate line from the 2 points. Lyft is not responsible for the provision of, or the failure to provide, Chase benefits or services. How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash, gift cards, travel, and pay with points for products or services made available through the program or directly from third parties. Redemption values for reward options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/Mastercard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/Mastercard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs Opens in a new window.Third-Party Merchants: The listed merchant(s) are in no way affiliated with Chase, nor are the listed merchant(s) considered sponsors or co-sponsors of this program. All trademarks are the property of their respective owner(s).Travel Through Chase Ultimate Rewards: When you use points to redeem for cash, each point is worth $.01 (one cent), which means that 100 points equals $1 in redemption value. Each point you redeem for travel booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards is worth $.0125 (one and a quarter cents), which means that 100 points equals $1.25 in redemption value, and points are worth 25% more than if redeemed for cash. For example, 60,000 points are worth $750 when redeemed for travel purchases, or $600 when redeemed for cash. The cost of travel is based on the rates and fares available through the Ultimate Rewards website and travel center, and may not reflect all rates and fares that are available through other sales channels.			If you choose to use points and your Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card to pay for your purchase, each point will be worth $.0125, but your credit card will be charged the full remaining dollar amount.My Chase Plan: An eligible purchase transaction for My Chase Plan is a purchase of at least $100, but may not include certain transactions, such as (a) cash-like transactions, (b) any fees owed to us, including Annual Membership Fees, and (c) purchases made under a separate promotion or special finance program.

If you change to another Chase credit card during the promotional period, your benefits may change. Mobile applications, websites and other information provided by Instacart are not within Chase's control and may or may not be available in Spanish. Chase is not responsible for the provision of, or the failure to provide, Instacart benefits and services. Your complimentary membership benefits may be removed if your eligible credit card account is closed or in default.Statement Credit on Instacart Purchases: Earn up to $15 per calendar quarter (for Chase Sapphire Preferred and Chase Sapphire cardmembers) in statement credits on qualifying Instacart purchases from 8/1/2022 through 7/31/2024 when you activate a complimentary Chase Instacart+ membership on Instacart.com/chase with your eligible Chase credit card. Calendar quarters are Jan – March, April – June, July – September, October – December, and the partial calendar quarters at the beginning and end of the promotional period. You can check the status of your enrollment in the Chase benefit within the Instacart+ section of the Instacart mobile app. You will continue to receive statement credit benefits regardless of whether you choose to renew your Instacart+ membership at the end of your complimentary period. Qualifying Instacart purchases include only those orders purchased by you, or an authorized user, with a Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card through Instacart.com or the Instacart mobile application (gift cards excluded). Statement credit(s) will post to your account within 48 hours of your qualifying Instacart purchase posting to your account and will appear on your monthly credit card billing statement within 1-2 billing cycles. Statement credits will be issued for the calendar quarter in which the transaction posts to your account. For example, if you pay for an Instacart order, but Instacart does not post the transaction until after the current calendar quarter ends, the cost of the Instacart purchase will be allocated towards the next calendar quarter's maximum, or will not qualify if the promotional period has ended. If you change to another Chase credit card during the promotional period, your benefits may change. Mobile applications, websites and other information provided by Instacart are not within Chase's control and may or may not be available in Spanish. Chase is not responsible for the provision of, or the failure to provide, Instacart benefits and services. Accounts must be open and not in default at the time the statement credit posts to your account.Earn 10 or 5 total points (""10X or 5X total points"") on Peloton equipment and accessory purchases through 03/31/2025: You'll earn a total of 10 (Sapphire Reserve or J.P. Morgan Reserve) or 5 (Sapphire Preferred) points for each $1 spent on up to $5,000 in total purchases when your card is used for Peloton equipment and accessory purchases over $150 through Peloton from 02/01/2023 through 03/31/2025. That's 9 (Sapphire Reserve or J.P. Morgan Reserve) or 4 (Sapphire Preferred) points on top of the 1 point you already earn on these purchases with your card. Only purchases made directly through Peloton – through onepeloton.com, over the phone, or in a Peloton showroom – are eligible. Purchases made outside the U.S. are not eligible. Gift cards, and apparel are not eligible. Points earned on the purchase of Peloton equipment and accessory purchases will be deducted from the cardmember's account if the order is cancelled or returned. Purchases must post to your account by the last day of the promotional period to qualify. Sometimes your card will be charged on a date after you make a purchase, such as the shipping date, and as a result the purchase may not post to your account until after the last day of the promotional period. Please allow 6 to 8 weeks after qualifying purchases post to your account for points to post to your account. To qualify for this bonus offer, account must be open and not in default at the time of fulfillment. This bonus offer is non-transferable.Complimentary 4th Night at Ennismore Hotel Properties: The Delano, Hyde, Mondrian, House of Originals and SLS hotels program benefits and Guest Privileges are available exclusively to Chase Sapphire cardmembers.

Cash Back rewards are tracked as points and each $1 in Cash Back rewards earned is equal to 100 points. You may simply see ""Cash Back"" in marketing materials when referring to the rewards you earn. You may also see, ""points"" or ""Ultimate Rewards points"" when referring to the points you can use. How you can earn points: You'll earn points on purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds, made with a Chase Freedom Flex credit card by you or an authorized user of the account. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn points: Balance transfers, cash advances or similar cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 1% Cash Back: You'll earn 1% Cash Back rewards for each $1 spent. 3% Cash Back in the drugstore and dining at restaurants categories: You'll earn 3% Cash Back rewards total for each $1 spent on purchases in the following rewards categories: drugstores and dining at restaurants including takeout and eligible delivery services (2% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). 5% Cash Back on Chase Travel bookings: You'll earn 5% Cash Back rewards total for each $1 spent on purchases made using your card through Chase Travel (4% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). 5% Cash Back in quarterly bonus categories: You'll earn 5% Cash Back rewards total for each $1 spent until $1,500 is spent on combined purchases in the quarterly bonus categories each quarter that you activate the bonus (4% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). You must activate your 5% Bonus Cash Back each quarter by the activation deadline. 5% Cash Back quarterly bonus categories may include individual select merchants in addition to bonus rewards categories. After $1,500 is spent on combined purchases in the quarterly bonus categories each quarter, you go back to earning 1% Cash Back rewards for each $1 spent, with no maximum. For more information on 5% Cash Back quarterly bonus offers, please visit chase.com/freedomflex Opens in a new window and select the Chase Freedom Flex FAQs link at the bottom of the page.

You may see ""5% Cash Back rewards"" in marketing materials to refer to the 4% Cash Back rewards earned in addition to the 1% Cash Back rewards earned on all purchases. The additional 4% Cash Back rewards will appear on your billing statement in a separate line from the 1% Cash Back rewards. Lyft is not responsible for the provision of, or the failure to provide, Chase benefits or services. How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash, gift cards, travel, and pay with points for products or services made available through the program or directly from third parties. Redemption values for reward options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your account is open, however, you'll immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/Mastercard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/Mastercard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs Opens in a new window.

We will mail your Rewards Program Agreement once your account is established. If you become a Chase Online customer, your Rewards Program Agreement will also be available after logging in to chase.com/ultimaterewards Opens in a new window.Cash Back and Points: ""Cash Back rewards"" are the rewards you earn under the program. Cash Back rewards are tracked as points and each $1 in Cash Back rewards earned is equal to 100 points. You may simply see ""Cash Back"" in marketing materials when referring to the rewards you earn. You may also see, ""points"" or ""Ultimate Rewards points"" when referring to the points you can use. How you can earn points: You'll earn points on purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds, made with a Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card by you or an authorized user of the account. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won't count and won't earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. 1.5% Cash Back: You'll earn 1.5% Cash Back rewards for each $1 spent. 3% Cash Back rewards total for each $1 spent on purchases in the following rewards categories: drugstores and dining at restaurants (1.5% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1.5% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). 5% Cash Back rewards total for each $1 spent on travel purchases booked using your card through the Ultimate Rewards program including available airline tickets, hotel accommodations, car rentals, activities and cruises (3.5% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1.5% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). 5% total Cash Back on qualifying Lyft rides through 03/2025: You'll earn an additional 3.5% Cash Back for each $1 spent when your card is used for qualifying Lyft products and services purchased through the Lyft mobile application through 03/31/2025. Qualifying Lyft products and services include rides taken in Classic, Shared, Lux, or XL modes; bike and scooter rides; and subscription and membership products. Purchase of gift cards, car rentals, vehicle service centers, miscellaneous fees, and other Lyft products and services are excluded from this promotion. Future Lyft products or services may not be eligible for additional Cash Back. You may see ""5% Cash Back rewards"" in marketing materials to refer to the 3.5% Cash Back rewards earned in addition to the 1.5% Cash Back rewards earned on all purchases. The additional 3.5% Cash Back rewards will appear on your billing statement in a separate line from the 1.5% Cash Back rewards. Lyft is not responsible for the provision of, or the failure to provide, Chase benefits or services. How you can use your points: You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash, gift cards, travel, and pay with points for products or services made available through the program or directly from third-party merchants. Redemption values for reward options vary. Points expiration/losing points: Your points don't expire as long as your account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/Mastercard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/Mastercard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won't qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs Opens in a new window.Amazon Shop with Points: When using points at checkout, each point is worth $0.008, which means that 100 points equals $0.80 in redemption value.Amazon.com Shop with Points service terms apply.Amazon, the Amazon.com logo, the smile logo, and all related logos are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.Zero Liability: Zero Liability Protection does not apply to use of an account by an authorized user without the approval of the primary cardmember.

Cellular Telephone Protection can reimburse the eligible Wells Fargo Consumer Credit Card cardholder for damage to, theft of, or involuntary and accidental parting of a cell phone. This is supplemental coverage not otherwise covered by another insurance policy (for example, cell phone insurance programs, or your homeowner’s, renter’s, automobile, or employer’s insurance policies) and may be applied after all other insurance is exhausted. Reimbursement is limited to the cost to repair or replace your original cell phone, less a $25 deductible with an allowable maximum of two paid claims per 12-month period. Each approved claim has a benefit limit of $600. This benefit does not cover cell phones that are lost (i.e., mysteriously disappear). This protection is only available when cell phone bills are paid with an eligible Wells Fargo Consumer Credit Card. The coverage does not apply if the cell phone bill is paid from a Wells Fargo Debit Card, Wells Fargo Business Credit Card, Wells Fargo Commercial Card or from a card that is linked to a Line of Credit. Eligible cell phones are the lines listed on your most recent cellular wireless service provider’s monthly billing statement for the billing cycle prior to when the incident occurred. Electronic failure or issues related to the software of the device are not covered.

Restaurant purchases include those made at merchants classified as full-service restaurants, cafes, cafeterias, fast-food locations, and restaurant delivery services.

This fee will remain the same until the ExtendPay Plan is paid in full. The monthly fixed fee of the ExtendPay Plan is based upon the original principal amount, Purchase APR, and other factors.An automatic statement credit of $15 per 12-month period will be applied to your U.S. Bank Altitude Go Visa Signature Card Account within 2 statement billing cycles following 11 consecutive calendar months of eligible streaming service purchases, such as Netflix, Hulu, Apple Music, if the Account is in good standing (open and able to use). Purchases qualify based on how merchants choose to classify their business and we reserve the right to determine which purchases qualify.
